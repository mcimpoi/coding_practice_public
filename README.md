## Mircea's coding practice

This is the public version of my coding practice repository.

This repository includes (or will include in the near future):

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) solutions (e.g. daily challenges, weekly contest...)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- Daily coding problem
- [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi)

I will submit code when time allows, and provide no guarantees on the published code, i.e. use it at your own risk. Also, there is no promise that I will publish solutions for all problems.

In the interest of fairness, I will publish solutions for contest problems **AFTER** the competition is over.

I hope the solutions are helpful, but, to make the most of these solutions, please try to solve the problems on your own first.
